# Research Papers by Zachery Kuykendall
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my research papers on various topics related to AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and more. The goal of this repository is to provide access to my work as I explore different aspects of emerging technologies and their applications.

I will continuously update this repository as I publish more papers over time. Contributions, discussions, and feedback are always welcome!

## Current Research Papers
1. RAGTune: Enhancing AI Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine-Tuning
- Summary: This paper introduces RAGTune, a novel MLOps pipeline that integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with incremental and adaptive fine-tuning techniques to improve long-term memory in AI models.
- Topics Covered:
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - Incremental and Adaptive Fine-Tuning
    - AI Memory and Learning Systems
    - MLOps Framework Design

## Future Papers
This repository will soon include research on the following topics:

- NeuraSearch: Cognitive AI for Intelligent Information Retrieval
    - Summary: NeuraSearch explores an AI-driven search system inspired by neural pathways and human cognitive processes to enhance the precision and contextual relevance of information retrieval.
    - Topics Covered:
        - AI in Information Retrieval
        - Cognitive Architecture in AI
        - Neural Pathways for Search Optimization
        - Human-Mimicked Learning Systems
    - Dopamine, Reward Systems, and AI-Driven Cognitive Enhancement
    - AI and Neural Pathways: Optimizing Learning Algorithms Based on Neural Plasticity
Stay tuned for updates as I add these and more papers to the collection.
